## 4. "Game of Life"
The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced "players", by creating patterns with particular properties.

## 4. Country Search Application
Application that provides basic information on a particular country, which a users types in a search bar. It also shows a chosen country on a map (highlighted in green). Application has autocomplete function.

### Technologies used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax.
The information about the countries is received from REST Countries Api. Map is taken from AmCharts.
Information received from REST Countries Api was modified. For example, the information on borders of a country was initially returned as abbreviation. I have modified it it be a full name of a country. In case a country does not share a border with other countries, the corresponding message is displayed (similar message is displayed in case there is no information provided for any of the categories).
Application is responsive (achieved with the usage of flexbox and media queries).

```
Due to technical problems with jQuery, not all features of the application are accessible. For example, autocomplete function that suggest a country based on the first two letters of a user's input, which is based on jQuery (namely jQuery UI), is not working at the moment.
Sorry for inconveniences.
