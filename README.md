Repository contains links to the project I have recently completed

## 1. Country Search Application
Application that provides basic information on a particular country, which a users types in a search bar. It also shows a chosen country on a map (highlighted in green). Application has autocomplete function.

### Technologies used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax.
The information about the countries is received from REST Countries Api. Map is taken from AmCharts.
Information received from REST Countries Api was modified. For example, the information on borders of a country was initially returned as abbreviation. I have modified it it be a full name of a country. In case a country does not share a border with other countries, the corresponding message is displayed (similar message is displayed in case there is no information provided for any of the categories).
Application is responsive (achieved with the usage of flexbox and media queries).

## 5. "Game of Life"
The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced "players", by creating patterns with particular properties.

## 5. "Sit on Chair" Webpage
Webpage that sells chairs. There is information about products and available plans, calculator that can be used to calculate prices of a particular chair, and form that allows to contact a company.
**Basic functionality** is added with JavaScript. For example, on smaller screens, menu is shown as a hamburger, and when a user clicks on it modal appears. There is a dropdown menu that expands/hides on clicking. The webpage has modal
The webpage is still **in working progress**, as some functionality features should be added. In particular, webpage should be responsive (written with the help of CSS flexbox). For now, only half of the webpage if responsive.

## 6. "Cat's Shelter" Webpage
The webpage is built in React. Styles are made in SASS.
The webpage is still **in work progress**, as some functionality features have to be added. For example, the webpage is not responsive yet. The table that allows to sort cats according to users input filters cats by their mane and like or dislike of kids. In the future, it should display an image of a selected cat instead.
